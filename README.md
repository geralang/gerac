# `gerarwc`
*A rewrite of the compiler for [the Gera programming language](https://github.com/geralang).*

This compiler is currently unfinished. The currently recommended implementation is [geralang/gerac](https://github.com/geralang/gerac), although it is highly unstable and will get replaced by this implementation in the future.

### Building from source

This project can be built using `make`. This project was developed using Java 17, but Java version 15 and above should also work.
